- Think about a travel adapter, e.g. where you need to fit a three-pin UK plug into a 2-pin socket in the USA or Europe - you need something in between; an adapter that can transform the "interface" of one into the other
- There are similar situations in software, e.g. where the "interface" from one part of your program to another doesn't quite fit
- Examples
	- You are having to integrate your existing system into an older legacy system
	- You are having to integrate your existing system with third party libraries or extensions
## Example: Stock Market Interface
- You have a shiny new dashboard that can visualise stock data, expecting the data to be in a JSON format
- You need to integrate with one of the industry-standard stock market APIs to obtain live and historical data
- Problem: the API will only return data to you in XML format, and you can't change it
- Solution: rewrite our own code to make it use XML instead? Maybe not.
- Solution 2: use an Adapter. Something that will sit between our system and the API, help your system interface to it in the way it needs to
### Starting Point
```Java
public class StockDataAPI {
	public JSON getStockData() {
		e.g. return "{ 'stock': { 'id': 'AAPL', 'price': 150 } }";
	}
}

public class DataDashboard {
	public void analyzeData(StockDataAPI api) {
		JSON data = api.getStockData();
		print(f"Analyzing JSON data: {json_data}");
	}
}

api = new StockDataAPI();
dashboard = new DataDashboard();
dashboard.analyzeData(api);
```
### Our Legacy API Library
```Java
// a Class we need to import from a third-party library
public class LegacyAPIForStockData {
	public XML getXMLStockDataFromProvider() {
		e.g. return "<stock><id>AAPL</id><price>150</price></stock>";
	}
}

// Our code:
import External.API.LegacyAPIForStockData;

api = new LegacyAPIForStockData();
dashboard = new DataDashboard();
dashboard.analyzeData(api); // X
```
### Create an Adapter
```Java
public class StockDataAPI {
	public JSON getStockData() {
		e.g. return  "{ 'stock': { 'id': 'AAPL', 'price': 150 } }";
	}
}

public class StockDataAPIAdapter extends StockDataAPI {
	@Override
	public JSON getStockData() {
		api = new LegacyAPIForStockData();
		data = api.getXMLStockDataFromProvider();
		json_data = transformXMLToJson(data);
		return json_data;
	}
}
```
### Using the Adapter
```Java
// Using the above code

api = new StockDataAPIAdapter();
dashboard = new DataDashboard();
dashboard.analyzeData(api);
```
## Benefits
- Our shiny new dashboard application remains "clean" - we didn't need to "pollute" it with logic to make it work with the old system
- We didn't have to go into the old system and modify it - and whatever maintenance challenges that could have presented
