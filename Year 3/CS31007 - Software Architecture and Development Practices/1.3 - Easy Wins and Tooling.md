## Clean Code: Commenting
- Comments should explain more of the "why" rather than "what"
- Avoid superfluous statements if they don't add value
```python
# Check if the age is greater than or equal to 18
if age >= 18:
	# Set authorized to true
	authorized = True
```
- Try something more meaningful:
```python
# only people aged 18yrs or older can be authorized to purchace alcohol
if age >= 18:
	authorized = True
```
- Aim for self-documenting code, if you can
- This code is rather cryptic:
```python
# Check if the user can login
if u.st == 1 and u.acc_type != 'G' and (today - u.last_pw_change).days < 90:
	# do something
```
- Making it more self-explanatory (albeit, more verbose, but would you prefer that "Future You" in six months needs 10 minutes of detective work trying to figure out what `u.st == 1` means?):
```python
is_active_user = user.status == Status.ACTIVE
is_not_guest = user.account_type != AccountType.GUEST
password_is_recent = user.days_since_password_change() < 90

if is_active_user and is_not_guest and password_is_recent:
	self.grant_access(user)
```
## Clean Code: Easy Wins - Formatting and Style
- Consistent indentation
- Consistent brace style { }
- Consistent naming conventions
- Even down to consistency of quotes (" " vs ' ')
- Pay attention to:
	- Language conventions, e.g. Python naming conventions vs Java
	- Team requirements - are you all adopting the same style consistency?
	- Organisational requirements, e.g. what is Google's style guide vs Microsoft, or Company A vs Company B?
## Easy Wins - Linting Tools
- A **linter** is a tool that analyzes your source code to identify issues
- Linters perform "static analysis" of your code, i.e. they exaine (the text of) your code without executing it
- Linters can check for:
	- Programming ussues
	- Bugs
	- Code styling issues
	- Coding best practices
	- Security issues
	- Unreachable or unused code
- They can assist with team-complance and consistency, and prevent unnecessary issues creeping into team repositories
- We all have a *lint*-erest in clean code!
### Linting Tools
- A number of popular linting tools exist
- For Python:
	- *Pylint*
	- *Flake8*
	- Others
- For Java:
	- *Checkstyle* for coding standards
	- *SpotBugs* to find bugs
- For JavaScript: 
	- *ESLint*
- For C and C++:
	- *Cppcheck*
	- *cpplint*
- Cross-language or multi-purpose tools:
- *SonarQube*
- *Semgrep*
- *PDM*

## Common workflow
- A developer works locally, with a linter built into their IDE for immediate checks and feedback
- A pre-commit hook can be used locally to run code through a linter before it is committed to Git, saving the repo from being cluttered with frustrating issues
- A commit to Git will trigger a GitHub Action to run a linter on the code base as a form of "gate keeper", ensuring the team-wide policies are being met by all developers.
