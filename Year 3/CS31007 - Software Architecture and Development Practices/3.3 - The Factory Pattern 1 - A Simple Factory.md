# The Factory Design Pattern - A "Simple" Factory
- Let's go back to the Navigation App
- Previously, we created a family of algorithms for route calculations depending on the mode of travel
![[Pasted image 20260202130645.png]]
- Let's say our code looks like this:
```Java
public class NavigationApp {
	public void calculateRoute(src, dest) {
		if (navType == "car") {
			CarRouteCalculator rc = new CarRouteCalculator();
			rc.calculateRoute(src, dest);
		}
		else if (navType == "walk") {
			WalkingRouteCalculator wrc = new WalkingRouteCalculator();
			wrc.calculateRoute(src, dest);
		}
		else if (navType == "cycle") {
			Etc.
		}
	}
}
```
- There is direct coupling between Navigation App and the specific types of route calculator
### How do we get rid of this creational responsibility?
- We move the responsibility somewhere else
- We can create a new object to take on this responsibility
- This new object's sole purpose in life will be to create or "manufacture" instances of objects for us
- We will call this a "Factory" object
## The Factory Object
```Java
public class RouteCalculatorFactory {
	public static void RouteCalculator getRouteCalculator(String type) {
		if (type == "car") {
			return new CarRouteCalculator();
		}
		else if (type == "walk") {
			return new WalkRouteCalculator();
		}
		else if (type == "cycle") {
			return new CycleRouteCalculator();
		}
		// Etc.. more types now and/or in the future
	}
}
```
## The Revised Navigation App with Factory
- The app now uses the Factory to obtain the relevant route calculator based on the type of navigation being done (e.g. "car", "walking")
- No direct coupling to specific / child route calculators both now and in the future
```Java
public class NavigationApp {
	public void calculateRoute(src, dest, navType) {
		RouteCalculator rc;
		rc = RouteCalculatorFactory.getRouteCalculator(navType);
		rc.calculateRoute(src, dest);
	}
}

NavigationApp na = new NavigationApp();
na.calculateRoute(src, dest, "car");
```

## Benefits
- Navigation App no longer has a direct coupling on specific types of Route Calculator that may exist, or which may be added or removed in the future
- Promotes flexibility and extensibility
- Prevents changes in the route calculators from causing impact to the Navigation App.
