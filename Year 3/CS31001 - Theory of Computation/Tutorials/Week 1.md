1.
a) $A = \{n|n\gt{5}\}$
b) $B = \{n|n\lt{5}, n\in \mathbb{N}\}$
c) $C = \{\epsilon\}$
d) $D = \emptyset$

2.
$A\times{B}$ contains $nm$ elements, since the size of the cartesian product of sets in the size of the two sets multiplied.

3.
since $a = b$, $a-b=0$, therefore, when dividing by $(a-b)$ you are dividing by $0$. so this is not possible.

4.
a) $AB = \{\{ab,c\},\{c,ca\}\}$
b) $B^2A = \{\{\{c,c\},ab\},\{\{ca\},c\}\}$
c) $A^2\cup B^2 = \{\{ab\},\{c\},\{ca\}\}$
