# Chapter 2 of "[The basics of information security](http://www.sciencedirect.com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/science/book/9780128007440)"
## Abstract
In this chapter, we cover the security principles of identification and [authentication](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/authentication "Learn more about authentication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). We discuss identification as a process by which we assert the identity of a particular party, whether this is true or not. We talk about the use of authentication as the means of validating whether the claim of identity is true. We also cover [multifactor authentication](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/multifactor-authentication "Learn more about multifactor authentication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and the use of [biometrics](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/biometrics "Learn more about biometrics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and hardware tokens to enhance surety in the [authentication process](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/authentication-process "Learn more about authentication process from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

## Conclusion
Identification is an assertion of the identity of a particular party. This can be a person, process, system, or other entity. Identification is only a claim of identity and does not imply that this claim is correct or any privileges that might be associated with the identity, if it is proven true.

Authentication is the process we use to validate whether the claim of identity is correct. It is important to note that authentication and verification are not the same things and that verification is a much weaker test from a security perspective.

When we [perform authentication](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/perform-authentication "Learn more about perform authentication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), we can use a number of factors. The main factors are something you know, something you are, something you have, something you do, and where you are. When we use an authentication mechanism that includes more than one factor, this is known as multifactor authentication. Using multiple factors gives us a much [stronger authentication](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/strong-authentication "Learn more about stronger authentication from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") mechanism than we might otherwise have.

## Abstract
This chapter discusses several issues that pertain to the human element of information security and why the people that staff our organizations to pose a security challenge that cannot be directly addressed with technical controls in every case. It covers items that we might want to discuss with users including: protecting data, passwords, social engineering, network usage, [malware](https://www-sciencedirect-com.libezproxy.dundee.ac.uk/topics/computer-science/malware "Learn more about malware from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), use of personal equipment on corporate networks, clean desk policies, and policy and regulatory knowledge. It also talks about what we can to do make our security awareness and training programs better, and the steps that we can take to make this information.
