### Question

You are the new security officer for a major webmail provider. You discover that users’ passwords are stored as salted MD5 hashes. Since this is insecure, you decide to upgrade to a secure password hash function, say PBKDF2. You have more than 10,000,000 users, some of them very active, others rarely log on, and some have not logged in for years.

#### i

Describe how you are going to upgrade the password database to take advantage of the new, secure hash function and describe any procedures that might change due to the upgrade.

### Question

Your mobile phone company lets you quickly top up your mobile phone credit through a web form into which you enter your phone number, the amount to top up and your credit card data. The company’s website is delivered to you insecurely over HTTP.

The form’s data is sent back to the company securely over HTTPS and your browser is redirected (over HTTPS) to your bank’s website for you to confirm the payment amount and provide a password.

Is this setup protecting the security of your payment? If so, justify your answer. If not, describe an attack that violates the security of your payment and explain why the attack succeeds in spite of the HTTPS protection.
