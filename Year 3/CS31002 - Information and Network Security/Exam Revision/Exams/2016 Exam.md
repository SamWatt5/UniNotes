### Question

Good sources of randomness are vital for cryptography. Suppose that the implementation of a simple messaging system uses a one-time pad with a flawed random bitstring generator. The generator is seeded with the encryption key obtained from a truly random source, but the flaw in the generator is that it repeats itself after every 10 bytes.

You are tasked with decrypting a 2000 bytes long ciphertext generated by this messaging system. You don’t have the decryption key, but you know that the plaintext is in English.

How will you attempt to decrypt the ciphertext?

### Question

In a typical authentication protocol the client sends her username and password over an encrypted channel to the server. The server applies a hash function to the received password, looks up the username and compares the hashed password to the hash stored for the user.

#### i

Why is there a need to store the passwords as hashes (instead of plaintexts) on the server? Give two reasons.

#### ii

Explain why password hashes must be salted. Then explain why salted, SHA-256 hashed passwords may still be vulnerable to attacks.

### Question

You are setting up a web application with a discussion forum stored in a SQL database on a web server. All communication with the web server is protected by transport layer security (TLS), and the web server does not allow insecure HTTP connections.

Discuss for each of the following attacks whether this setup provides any protection against the attack. You may assume that TLS is implemented correctly, certificates are verified, and no rogue certificates are installed.

#### i

Cross-site scripting (XSS)

### Question

Suppose you want to log in to my.dundee.ac.uk and access the website over SSL/TLS.

#### i

Your browser runs the SSL handshake protocol and receives a certificate chain from the webserver. Why is it important that the browser verifies the entire chain rather than just the X.509 certificate for my.dundee.ac.uk?

#### ii

The certificate signing my.dundee.ac.uk’s certificate refers to a server that stores the certificate revocation list. Why is it important to ensure that there are no denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on servers that publish certificate revocation lists?
