### Question

Suppose the TRUST-US certificate authority is compromised and issues rogue TLS certificates. Suppose further that TRUST-US’s root certificates are installed in every major browser and operating system.

You operate a secure web server that only communicates over TLS. Your web server’s public key certificate is signed by a trustworthy certificate authority, different from TRUST-US.

Does the fact that TRUST-US has been compromised affect the security of the transactions between your webserver and your customers?

### Question

Bob would like to email a highly confidential document to Alice. Alice decides that Bob must encrypt the document before sending it to her. For this purpose Alice generates an RSA public/private key pair and emails the public key to Bob.

Is it safe for Bob to use the received public key to encrypt the document for Alice?
