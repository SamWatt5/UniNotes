## a
### Question
A cryptosystem must be secure even if the adversary knows everything about the crypto system, i.e., the entire design and its functionality, except for a short key.
### Answer
This is known as Kerckhoff's Principle
This is Shannon's Theorem

### Question
Suppose the TRUST-US certificate authority is compromised and issues rogue TLS certificates. Suppose further that TRUST-US’ root certificates are installed in every major browser and operating system. Suppose you check that the certificate chain of your online banking session keys leads back to the root certificate of an unrelated, trustworthy certificate authority and not TRUST-US. Can you be certain that the security of your present online banking session is not affected by TRUST-US’ breach?

## d
### Question
The ciphertext c is the result of an AES encryption of one of two possible 128 bit messages. Message 1 is the all 0 bit string and message 2 is the all 1 bit string. If the adversary does not know the randomly chosen encryption key k, can the adversary efficiently decrypt the ciphertext?
### Answer

## e
### Question
The ciphertext c is the result of an RSA encryption of one of two distinct 512 bit messages. The adversary knows the 1024 bit public key and the two messages. The adversary does not know the private key. Can the adversary efficiently find out which of the two messages the plaintext is?

### Question
Consider the following protocol to open a smart car with your smart phone. The car has a serial number *s* that is also stored on the smart phone. The car and smart phone also share a 256bit secret *k* and each stores a counter *c*. 
1. The car sends out a message with its serial number *s*. 
2. When the smart phone receives the message *s*, it authenticates itself to the car by sending 
   *sha256(k, c+1)* 
   and then storing the counter *c+1*. 
3. When the car receives a hash value *h*, it compares *h* to the values 
   *sha256(k, c+1)*,*sha256(k, c+2)*, and *sha256(k, c+3)*. 
   If the received hash matches one of these three hash values, the car unlocks the door and increases the counter *c* to the appropriate value. Else it sends an error message, but does not increase its counter *c*.
#### i
This protocol is vulnerable to a denial of service attack. Describe the attack.
#### ii
Aside from the DOS attack, is the protocol secure? If so, give a reason why. If not, describe how an attacker can break into the car
