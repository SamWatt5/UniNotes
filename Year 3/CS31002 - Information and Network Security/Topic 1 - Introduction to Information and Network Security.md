# The need for security: Threats, Risks and Attacks
## General Definitions
- **Cybersecurity** deals with prevention and detection of improper actions by users of **information systems**
- Similarly, network security, web security, database security etc. concern detection and prevention of improper actions by users of resources in their specific domains.
- **Information security** is more general:
	- It deals with the proper use of information, independent of computer systems

## Examples of security breaches
### Equifax website hack in 2017
- Information accessed included names, social security numbers, birth dates, addresses and driver license numbers.
- Access occurred May - July 2017
- Hack was discovered 29 July 2017
- Reported by Equifax 7 September 2017
- 44% of US population affected, certain UK and Canadian residents affected too

### Sony PlayStation hack
- Account data of 77 million users stolen
- Data included:
	- Name, address, credit card data, billing address, email, birthdate, username, password, purchase history, security questions and answers
- Direct costs to Sony: $175 million
- Loss of customers and reputation. Lawsuits

### Wanna Cry Ransomware
- March 2017: Microsoft patches the "EternalBlue" vulnerability in windows 7 through 10
- April 2017: "Shadow Brokers" (a hacker group) publish (leak) a hacking/malware tool that they allegedly stole from the NSA
- The malware exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability, which Microsoft had patched in March. The vulnerability was also present in Windows XP (which has been unsupported since April 2014) and other unsupported versions that Microsoft didn't patch
- 13 May 2017: Ransomware based on the leaked source code infects computers worldwide. Hospitals are affected as they still use Windows XP, but also Telcom and Telefonica in Spain.
- Microsoft patches the vulnerability in XP and other unsupported windows versions

### Ransomware
- 2013: "Cryptolocker" hijacks 250,000 computers worldwide for a ransom of $100 each
- 2017: Wann Cry demands $300 ransom
- 2019: IT systems of several US city governments are hijacked, attackers demand $500,000
- Ransom to be paid in bitcoin

These problems are so critical because they affect our basic infrastructures, which are increasingly based on networked information systems.

## General Definitions
- **Confidentiality:** Property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised entities
- **Integrity:** Property of accuracy and completeness
- **Availability:** Property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorised entity
These are the most common information security properties, also referred to as the **CIA** properties

## Why are systems insecure?
- **Limited Resources**
	- Development costs time and money
	- must balance cost of security with potential loss
- **Changing Environment**
	- 1990s Internet, 2000s Google, Social Networking, 2010s Cloud Computing, Internet of things, AI,...
- **Enormous Complexity of Software**
