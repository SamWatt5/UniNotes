## App Concept
### App Name
Noteworthy
### App Purpose
Noteworthy is a music ideation app designed for capturing, organizing, and developing song ideas on the go. Musicians often experience sudden bursts of inspiration, whether its a lyric line, a hummed riff, or a chord progression, but lose them because existing tools are fragmented. Voice memos record audio but lack structure; Notes allow text, but don't link to sound; DAWs are too complex for quick use. Noteworthy combines lyrics, audio snippets, and chord progressions into one streamlined mobile workspace, so creative sparks are never lost.
### Why This app?
Unlike traditional note-taking apps or professional music production software, Noteworthy is lightweight, intuitive, and purpose-built for songwriters of every level. It focuses on speed, simplicity, and reusability. In one screen users can quickly:
- Write lyric snippets
- Tag their snippets, i.e. verse or chorus
- Record audio riffs directly through the phone's microphone
- Build chord progressions, with instant playback
- Organize all pieces into "Song Projects" that can evolve over time
Where similar apps, such as Voice Memos, or Notes, lack integration with each other, and DAWs have too many technical features for ideating the song, Noteworthy is unique. It creates a creative bridge between casual sketching and professional songwriting. It's an ideal tool for hobbyists who want a creative outlet, to professionals who need to organize fleeting ideas during their busy schedules.
### Example Scenario
Georgia, an aspiring songwriter, is riding the bus when a catchy chorus melody pops into her head. She opens Noteworthy and immediately records herself humming the idea. To give the melody a bit of context, she adds a chord progression (C-Am-F-G) using the built-in chord builder. Later that evening, at home, she writes a few lyrics into the app, tagging them as "chorus". When Georgia reviews her projects before band rehearsal, she finds her riff, the chord progression, and the lyrics, all neatly organised under one "Song Project". During her rehearsal, Georgia shares her project with her guitarist. Instead of sifting through scattered voice memos and notebooks, her ideas are already structured, easy to understand, and ready to develop further. The app turns what could have been a lost idea into the foundations for a new song.
