## **1. Database Planning**

- A structured approach to database system development.
- Integrated with the **Information Systems (IS) strategy**.
- Defines **mission objectives**: Each database function should serve a specific goal.
- Planning covers scope, implementation, integration, standards, and data storage.

## **2. Views (User Perspectives)**

- **User views** define what data different roles (e.g., manager, marketing, stock control) need.
- Three approaches:
    - **Centralized Approach**: Merges all requirements into one database model.
    - **View Integration Approach**: Each user view is modeled separately and then merged.
    - **Combined Approach**: Mix of both.
- **Views (Virtual Tables)**:
    - Restrict access to sensitive data.
    - Improve security and efficiency.
    - Can be **read-only** or **updateable**.

## **3. Transactions (Logical Units of Work)**

- Transactions ensure **atomicity** (must complete entirely or not at all).
- SQL commands:
    - `COMMIT`: Saves all changes.
    - `ROLLBACK`: Undoes changes if an error occurs.
- **Desirable Properties of Transactions (ACID)**
    - **Atomicity**: All-or-nothing execution.
    - **Consistency**: Maintains database integrity.
    - **Isolation**: No interference from concurrent transactions.
    - **Durability**: Once committed, changes are permanent.

## **4. Transaction Concurrency & Locking**

- **Concurrency Issues**:
    - **Lost Update**: Two users update the same data simultaneously.
    - **Uncommitted Dependency**: Reading uncommitted changes.
    - **Inconsistent Analysis**: Partial changes seen.
    - **Deadlock**: Two transactions block each other.
- **Locking Mechanisms**:
    - **Read Locks (Shared Locks)**: Multiple users can read but not write.
    - **Write Locks (Exclusive Locks)**: Prevents simultaneous updates.
    - **Two-Phase Locking**: Locks acquired before changes, released after.

## **5. Database Security**

- **Why security matters**: Prevents data theft, fraud, and breaches.
- Security measures:
    - **User authentication**: Ensures only authorized access.
    - **Access control**: Limits data access based on user roles.
    - **Views**: Restricts access to sensitive data.
    - **Encryption**: Secures stored and transmitted data.
    - **Backup & Recovery**: Restores data in case of failure.

## **6. Threats to Databases**

- **Technical threats**:
    - Hardware failures (power surges, fire, flooding).
    - Database corruption or unauthorized modifications.
    - Network attacks (hacking, eavesdropping).
- **Human threats**:
    - Insider threats (employees with malicious intent).
    - External threats (hackers, password attacks).
    - Viruses, malware, and denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.

## **7. Countermeasures**

- **Computer-based controls**:
    - Physical security (locks, restricted access).
    - **Access control policies**: Permissions for different users.
    - **Views**: Hide sensitive data from unauthorized users.
    - **Encryption**: Encodes data to prevent unauthorized access.
    - **Backup & journaling**: Restores data after a failure.

## **8. SQL Injection Attacks**

- **How SQL Injection works**:
    - Malicious SQL commands inserted into web forms.
    - Example: `"SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE USERID = 456 OR 1=1;"` → Gives all users' data.
    - Worst case: `DROP TABLE USERS;` → Deletes an entire database.
- **Prevention methods**:
    - **Parameterized queries**.
    - **Stored procedures**.
    - **Escaping special characters**.

## **9. Hardware Security & Fault Tolerance**

- **RAID Technology**:
    - **RAID 0**: No redundancy.
    - **RAID 1**: Mirrored data.
    - **RAID 5**: Distributed parity for fault tolerance.
- **Fault-tolerant hardware**:
    - Redundant disks, power supplies, and cooling systems.

## **10. Internet Security**

- **Challenges**:
    - Internet traffic is vulnerable to interception.
    - Protocols like **TCP/IP and HTTP lack built-in security**.
- **Security measures**:
    - **Firewalls & proxy servers**.
    - **SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption**.
    - **Digital certificates & signatures**.
