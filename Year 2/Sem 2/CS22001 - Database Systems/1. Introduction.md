### Introduction to Databases

- Defines databases and emphasizes the exponential growth of data in the digital age.
- Provides statistics on data generation in 2024, such as tweets, Instagram posts, and searches.
- Illustrates the scale of data with analogies to paper sheets and distances.

### Data Hierarchy

- Explains the transformation from **data** to **information**, **knowledge**, and finally **wisdom**.
- Emphasizes the importance of visualization in understanding data, using historical and scientific examples.

### Historical Data Analysis Example

- Describes the 1854 cholera outbreak case study by John Snow.
- Demonstrates how database relationships can be mapped to real-world scenarios.

- Can be completed individually or in pairs.

### Software Development vs. Database Development

- Stages include: Requirements, Design, Implementation, Verification, and Maintenance.
- Database-specific stages include: Conceptual, Logical, and Physical design.

### Relational Database Rules

1. **Information Rule:** Data is stored in table cells.
2. **Guaranteed Access Rule:** Data is accessible via table name, row ID, and column name.
3. **Physical Data Independence:** Applications should not depend on physical data structure.

### Entity-Relationship Modelling

- Steps to model a relational database:
    - Identifying **entities**, their **attributes**, and the **relationships** between them.
    - Example: A recipe book database involving recipes, ingredients, and authors.
    - Recognizing **many-to-many relationships** such as recipes containing multiple ingredients.

### Conceptual vs. Logical Design

- The conceptual model represents real-world entities and their relationships.
- Logical design focuses on structuring data to be efficiently stored and queried.
