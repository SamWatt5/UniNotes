### Review of Week 1

- Importance of databases and their value in extracting meaningful insights.
- Hierarchical databases exist, but relational databases are the focus for this course.

### Introduction to Relational Databases

- **Relational Databases:** Store data in tables with records (rows) and attributes (columns).
- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagrams:** Used to model relational databases by defining:
    - **Entities:** Objects to store data about.
    - **Attributes:** Properties of entities.
    - **Relationships:** How entities are connected.

### Conceptual Database Design

- The process starts with identifying entities, attributes, and relationships.
- Example model: A **recipe book** that contains recipes, written by authors, and consisting of ingredients.
- **Multiplicity (Cardinality):** Specifies how many entities are involved in relationships:
    - `1..*` means "one or more."
    - `1` means "only one."
    - `0..1` means "optional (zero or one)."

### Relationships in Relational Databases

- **Types of relationships:**
    
    - **One-to-One (1:1):** Each entity instance relates to at most one instance of another entity.
    - **One-to-Many (1:M):** One entity relates to multiple instances of another entity.
    - **Many-to-Many (M:M):** Both entities can relate to multiple instances of each other, requiring a **joining table**.
- **Example:**
    
    - Recipe â†” Ingredient (many-to-many) requires a linking table `Recipe_Ingredient`.

### Keys in Relational Databases

- **Primary Key (PK):** Uniquely identifies records.
- **Candidate Key:** Minimal set of attributes to uniquely identify a record.
- **Composite Key:** A primary key composed of multiple attributes.
- **Foreign Key (FK):** References a primary key in another table to establish relationships.

### Normalization in Databases

Normalization is essential to reduce data redundancy and ensure integrity. The process follows:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF):**
    
    - Ensure each cell contains a single value (atomicity).
    - Remove duplicate rows and columns.
    - No repeating lists in cells.
2. **Second Normal Form (2NF):**
    
    - Must be in 1NF.
    - Ensure all non-key attributes are fully dependent on the primary key.
    - Remove partial dependencies.
3. **Third Normal Form (3NF):**
    
    - Must be in 2NF.
    - Eliminate transitive dependencies (attributes should depend only on the primary key).

### Common Database Anomalies

- **Insertion Anomaly:** Unable to insert data without dependent data.
- **Update Anomaly:** Inconsistent data updates due to redundancy.
- **Deletion Anomaly:** Deleting one piece of data removes unintended linked information.
