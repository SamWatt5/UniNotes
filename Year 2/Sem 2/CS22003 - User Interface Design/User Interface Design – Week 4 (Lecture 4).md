### **Physical Impairments**

- **1 in 400 children** are born with **cerebral palsy**, affecting fine or gross motor control.

### **Cognitive Impairments**

- **200 babies per week** are born with learning disabilities.
- **Dementia** affects **5% of people over 65** and **20% of those over 80**.
- **Neurodevelopmental conditions** (e.g., ADHD, Autism) impact user experience and interaction.

### **Mental Health**

- Microsoft‚Äôs **Design for Mental Health Guidebook** emphasizes:
    - **Preserving focus and control**.

## **Web Accessibility**

### **Assistive Technology**

- Defined by the **World Health Organization (WHO)** as devices or systems that **help individuals perform tasks they otherwise could not**.
- Examples:
    - **Screen readers**.
    - **Screen magnifiers**.
    - **Braille output devices**.
    - **Joysticks and alternative input devices**.
    - **Accessibility apps and software**.

### **How Screen Readers Work**

- Convert text into **spoken words or Braille output**.
- Used by individuals with **visual impairments**.

### **Importance of Web Accessibility**

- Ensures **equal access to information**.
- Compliance with **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**.

### **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)**

- Developed by the **World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)**.
- Adopted as an **ISO standard**.
- Success criteria categorized into **three levels**:
    - **A (Basic Accessibility)**.

## **Emoji Accessibility Case Study**

### **Issues with Emoji Accessibility**

- **Visual ambiguity**: Some emojis have unclear meanings for visually impaired users.
- **Screen reader inconsistencies**:
    - JAWS describes üò§ as ‚Äúface with look of triumph‚Äù.
    - VoiceOver describes it as ‚Äúhuffing with anger face‚Äù.
    - Users prefer descriptions that match **context** rather than Unicode definitions.
- **Cultural differences**:
    - A blind user may **not recognize a gesture** if they have never seen it.
    - Example: The **prayer emoji** (üôè) is often mistaken for a **high-five**.

### **Research Areas for Improving Emoji Accessibility**

1. **Better descriptors** for screen readers.
2. **Enhanced tools for emoji search and categorization**.
3. **Consistent rendering across different platforms**.
4. **Support for a wider range of emoji meanings**.
5. **Inclusion of diverse user needs in emoji design**.
