## **Usability and Design Principles**

### **Key Characteristics of Usability**

A system with a high degree of usability should be:

- **Efficient:** Users complete tasks with an appropriate level of effort.
- **Effective:** Contains necessary functions and information, structured logically.
- **Easy to Learn:** Users can quickly understand how to use the system.
- **Safe to Operate:** Usable in various contexts without leading to errors.
- **High Utility:** Helps users achieve their goals.
- **Memorable:** Easy to recall how to use after some time.

## **Usability Heuristics and Principles**

### **Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics**

A widely used set of usability guidelines for designing user-friendly systems.

### **Usability Design Principles (Gould & Lewis, 1985)**

- **Early Focus on Users and Tasks:** Understanding user needs from the start.
- **Empirical Measurement:** Testing using scenarios, simulations, and prototypes.
- **Iterative Design:** Repeated cycles of design, testing, and revision.
- **Integrated Usability:** All usability aspects should evolve together under unified responsibility.

## **Acceptability and Technology Adoption**

### **Definition of Acceptability**

- Acceptability refers to whether users are willing to adopt new technology for specific tasks.
- Example: Is a robot nanny acceptable?

### **Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, Bagozzi, & Warshaw, 1989)**

- Developed in business studies, focuses on technology adoption.
- Two key factors influence acceptance:
    - **Ease of Use:** How simple the technology is to learn and use.
    - **Effectiveness:** How well the technology helps users complete tasks.
- Different variants of TAM exist, adapting to different technologies.

## **Gestalt Laws of Perception**

### **Basic Concept**

- The human eye perceives objects as part of a whole rather than individual elements.

### **Key Gestalt Principles**

- **Proximity:** Objects close together are perceived as related.
- **Continuity:** We perceive smooth, continuous patterns rather than disconnected ones.
- **Part-Whole Relationships:** The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
- **Similarity:** Objects that look similar are grouped together.
- **Closure:** Incomplete shapes are perceived as complete due to the brain filling in missing information.

## **Common Usability Mistakes**

- Poor navigation and structure.
- Overloading users with too much information.
- Lack of feedback when actions are performed.
- Ignoring accessibility needs.

---

## **Prototyping**

### **Types of Prototypes**

#### **Low-Fidelity Prototypes**

- Focus on **broad design ideas**, such as **functionality and navigation**.
- Created quickly to explore different design solutions.
- Used in early-stage testing and brainstorming.

#### **High-Fidelity Prototypes**

- **Detailed designs** incorporating **visuals, interactivity, and functionality**.
- Used for **finalizing design details** before development.
- Important for **client approval** and **usability testing**.

---

## **Choosing Suitable Representations**

- Good design representations remove unnecessary details while highlighting key features.
- Representations should be **accurate enough** to reflect real-world usage but **simple enough** to avoid confusion.
- The **style of presentation** should align with the **purpose** of the design.

---

## **Wireframes**

- Simple sketches or layouts showing the structure of a design.
- Focus on **layout and content placement**, not final visual details.
- Common in both **app and web design**.
- Wireframing tools provide **templates for specific devices** (e.g., iPhone).

## **Wizard of Oz Prototyping**

- A method where part of a system is simulated by a human instead of actual technology.
- Named after the scene in _The Wizard of Oz_ where the "wizard" is revealed to be a regular person behind a curtain.
- Example:
    - A study tested voice-controlled TVs by having a hidden researcher manually operate the remote in response to user commands.
    - Users believed they were interacting with a functional voice system.

### **Ethical Considerations**

- The technique can mislead participants, raising ethical concerns.
- In studies, researchers should reveal the deception at the end of the test.

## **Additional Topics to Explore**

- **Accessibility** (covered in next week’s lecture).
- **Memory, Attention, Navigation** (not covered in detail this week).
