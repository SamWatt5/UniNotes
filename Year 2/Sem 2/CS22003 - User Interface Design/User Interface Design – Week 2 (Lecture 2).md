## **Command Language vs. Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

### **Command Language**

- A structured set of words with syntax rules used for issuing commands (e.g., UNIX, voice commands like Alexa).
- **Issues:**
    - Users must recall specific commands from a large set.
    - Syntax rules can be complex and difficult to remember.

### **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**

- Allows **direct manipulation (DM)** of objects via pointing devices.
- **Characteristics:**
    - Continuous representation of objects.
    - Physical actions or labeled buttons replace complex syntax.
    - Rapid, reversible actions with immediate visual feedback.

---

## **WIMP (Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointing devices)**

- **Windows:** Allow multiple applications to share screen space.
- **Icons:** Visual symbols representing apps or objects.
- **Menus:** Lists of commands/options (hierarchical, pop-up, contextual).
- **Pointing devices:** Mouse, stylus, touchscreens, game controllers.

---

## **Interface Metaphors**

- Visuals and actions in the interface leverage users' real-world knowledge.
- Example: The "desktop" metaphor in operating systems.

---

## **Icons**

- Used in software, public kiosks, street signs.
- **Effective icon design principles:**
    - Understandable, familiar, unambiguous, memorable, informative.
    - Should be distinct, attractive, legible, compact, and coherent.

---

## **GUI Widgets**

- Common interface elements:
    - Buttons, text boxes, tabs, menus, scrollbars, sliders, progress bars.
- **Radio Buttons:** Exclusive selection.
- **Checkboxes:** Multiple selections possible.

---

## **Alerts and Attention**

- Alerts are meant to grab user attention.
- **Challenges:**
    - Can be distracting or overwhelming.
    - Must be designed to balance urgency and usability.

---

## **Types of User Interfaces**

- **Mobile Interfaces**
- **Desktop Interfaces**
- **Voice Interfaces**
- **AR & VR Interfaces**
    - **Augmented Reality (AR):** Overlays digital content onto the real world (e.g., Pok√©mon GO).
    - **Virtual Reality (VR):** Fully immersive environments (e.g., Oculus VR).
- **Gesture-Based Interfaces:** Use motion sensors (e.g., Microsoft Kinect).

---

## **User-Centered Design (UCD)**

- **Definition:** Iterative process focusing on user needs, behaviors, and goals.
- **Key principles:**
    - Understand user context.
    - Design for accessibility and inclusivity.
    - Iterate based on user feedback.
    - Test usability at every stage.

---

## **Usability Design Principles (Gould & Lewis, 1985)**

- **Early focus on users and tasks.**
- **Empirical measurement:** Use scenarios, simulations, prototypes.
- **Iterative design:** Cycle of testing, measuring, and refining.
- **Integrated usability:** Ensuring all usability factors evolve together.

---

## **Personas in UX Design**

### **What is a Persona?**

- A fictional but research-based user representing a group of real users.
- Helps in **avoiding self-referential design** by focusing on real user needs.

### **Origins: Alan Cooper (Father of Personas)**

- Introduced personas while designing a project management tool.
- Found that designing for a fictional user improved usability.

### **Characteristics of a Persona**

- **Not a real person** but based on research.
- **Not a stereotype** but an archetype representing user behavior.
- **Includes:**
    - Demographics (age, gender, location, occupation, education).
    - Interests, personality, emotions.
    - Motivations, goals, frustrations.

---

## **Persona Development Approaches**

1. **Goal-Directed Personas:** Focus on what users want to achieve.
2. **Role-Based Personas:** Based on organizational roles and objectives.
3. **Engaging Personas:** Vivid, relatable depictions, often visual.
4. **Fictional Personas:** Created without real research, useful in early design phases.

### **Data-Driven vs. Exploratory Personas**

- **Data-Representative Personas (DRPs):** Based on real research and user data.
- **Exploratory Personas (EPs):** Assumptions-based, used for brainstorming.

---

## **Personas and Scenarios**

- **Scenario:** A story depicting how a persona interacts with a product.
- **Scenarios help designers** understand user interactions and frustrations.

### **Example Scenario**

- Bill is looking for a cooking class using an app.
- He finds an interesting class but realizes the app lacks accessibility info.
- He has to call each provider manually, leading to frustration.
- The designers now understand a key **usability issue**.

---

## **Scenarios vs. User Stories**

- **Scenarios:** Describe **how** users interact with a system in context.
- **User Stories:** Define **what** functionality users need to complete tasks.
