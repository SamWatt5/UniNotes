### **What is HCI (Human-Computer Interaction)?**

- **Study of people using computers** and designing systems to improve usability.
- **Definition:**  
    _“Discipline concerned with the design, evaluation, and implementation of interactive computing systems for human use.”_
- Evolved beyond computers to include **mobile phones, smart devices, streaming, AR, etc.**

#### ** Why is HCI Important?**

- Helps **design better user experiences**.
- Ensures systems are **usable, efficient, and meet people’s needs**.
- **Key areas:**
    - **Human-Centered Design (HCD)** & **User-Centered Design (UCD)**
    - **Man-Machine Interfaces (MMI)**
    - **User Experience (UX)** & **Interaction Design (IxD)**

### ** Tech Timeline (Major Milestones)**

- **1937** – First electronic digital computer
- **1974** – First personal computers (Altair 8800)
- **1989** – Internet & World Wide Web
- **2007** – iPhone launch revolutionizes mobile UX
- **2023** – ChatGPT & AI-driven interfaces

---

### ** HCI Beyond the Internet**

- **Not all computer tech uses the internet!**
- Examples:
    - **Personal medical devices** (e.g., insulin pumps)
    - **Household appliances** (e.g., smart fridges, washing machines)
    - **Educational toys & games**

---

### ** Case Study: iPhone (2007)**

- **Impact:**
    - First mass-adopted touchscreen device.
    - **App Store (2008)** created a new software industry.
    - Introduced **directional sensors & gesture-based UI**.
    - Inspired similar designs in **Android & Windows devices**.

---

### ** Human-Centered Design (HCD)**

- **Design should focus on:**
    
    - What people want to do **(user needs)** rather than what tech can do.
    - Creating **new ways to connect people**.
    - **Involving users in the design process**.
    - Designing for **diversity & accessibility**.
- **Challenges:**
    
    - Machines require **strict instructions**, while **people express desires naturally**.
    - Many designers take a **machine-centered** approach (faster but less user-friendly).

---

### ** Why Invest in Human-Centered Design?**

- **More costly** due to **user research, testing, and prototyping**.
- However, it leads to **better usability, adoption, and customer satisfaction**.
- Companies benefit by creating **more engaging and effective products**.
