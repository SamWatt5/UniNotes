# 1. Whole Steps and Half Steps
Music is built on distances between notes, called **intervals**. The two smallest intervals are:
- **Half step (H)**: Moving one fret up or down
- **Whole step (W)**: moving two frets up or down
- Example: From open E string, a half step would be 1st fret (F) and a whole step from there would be 3rd fret (G)

# 2. The Major Scale Formula
The **Major Scale** is the backbone of western music. It is built with the following step pattern:
**W - W - H - W - W - W - H**
If we start on C, and follow this pattern it gives the following:
C -> D (W)
D -> E (W)
E -> F (H)
F -> G (W)
G -> A (W)
A -> B (W)
B -> C (H)
This gives the **C major scale**: C D E F G A B C
*Note: There are no sharps or flats in C major, which is often why its the first one taught*

# 3. Playing C Major on Guitar
Let's Try two versions:
**Open Position (first 3 frets):**
```TAB
e|-------------------0-1-|
B|-------------0-1-3-----|
G|---------0-2-----------|
D|---0-2-3---------------|
A|-3---------------------|
E|-----------------------|
```
**Two-Octave Shape (starting 8th fret, low E string):**
```TAB
e|------------------7-8--|
B|--------------8-10-----|
G|--------7-9-10---------|
D|----7-9----------------|
A|--10-------------------|
E|8----------------------|
```
^^^^THIS IS WRONG, stupid AI
# 4. Intervals (Hearing the Distance)
Intervals are the distance between the two notes.
Some key ones to remember are:
- **Octave**: Same note, higher/lower (i.e. C to C)
- **3rd**: C -> E (sounds "sweet/happy")
- **5th**: C -> G (sounds "strong/open")
On guitar:
- Octaves are found by going two strings up and two frets up
- 3rd & 5th can be played by skipping strings or stacked inside chords
try singing these intervals while playing them - it trains your ear
