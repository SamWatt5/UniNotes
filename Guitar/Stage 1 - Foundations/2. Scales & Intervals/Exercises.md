## 1. Step Recognition
Pick any fret, move up a half step, then a whole step - say out loud what note you land on
## 2. Play C major scale
in both open position and 2-octave position
## 3. Sing + play intervals
Play a note, then its 3rd and 5th. Sing the difference
## 4. Mini improv 
Take just 3 notes from C major and make up short riffs
# 5. Guitar Application
- take small fragments of the C major scale (say 3 notes at a time) and make little riffs
- Example: play C-D-E on the A string, then create a melody by shuffling them
- Try improvising over a C major backing track, even with just 3-4 notes
