# 1: The Musical Alphabet
- The musical notes are named **A, B, C, D, E, F, G** 
- These notes repeat over and over, i.e. A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,...
- Between these notes are **Sharps (#)**  or **Flats (b)**
- There are **no** sharps or flats between **B->C** and **E->F**
- The sharp of a note is the same as the flat of the next note
- A, A#/Bb, B, C, C#/Db, D, D#/Eb, E, F, F#/Gb, G#/Ab
- This forms a total of **12** notes

# 2: Octaves & Shapes on Guitar
- An **octave** is the name for one repeat of the notes i.e. A->G
- To play a note an octave higher on guitar, you play the note **12** frets to the right of the note you are on
- i.e. 5th fret (A) -> 17th fret (A)
- The **octave shape** on guitar lets you play an octave without moving 12 frets
- If you play the note on the low E string, the octave would be two strings down, and two frets up
- i.e. 5th fret E String (A) -> 7th fret D String (A)
