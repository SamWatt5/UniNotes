## 1. Note Finding Game
- Say out loud "Find C on the 6th string"
- Quickly locate it (8th fret)
- Repeat with different notes
## 2. Memorize Landmarks
- Lock in 5th, 7th, 12th frets (A,B,E on E string/D,E,A on A string)
- Use these as reference points
## 3. Octave Drill
- Play a note on the E string, then jump to its octave shape
- Example: 3rd fret E string (G) -> 5th fret D string (G)
- Do this with different notes

# Guitar Application
- Pick a simple riff (i.e. Smoke on the water, or seven nation army)
- Try playing it in a different spot, keeping the same notes
